        <img src="images/kanto-map.jpg" height=400 <p>The Kanto region is the first region introduced in the
        Pokémon series.
        It
        is home to many iconic Pokémon
        and the
        original eight gyms.Kanto Pokémon are the original 151 creatures from the first generation of Pokémon games
        (Red,
        Blue, Yellow, FireRed, LeafGreen, Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee) set in the Kanto region, featuring iconic starters
        like
        Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and legendaries such as Mewtwo and the Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres trio,
        forming the
        foundational Pokédex that introduced trainers to the world of Pokémon battles and exploration.The main Pokémon
        Professor in the Kanto region is Professor Samuel Oak, based in Pallet Town, who studies human-Pokémon
        relationships, gives starter Pokémon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle) to new trainers, and tasks them with
        completing the Pokédex. Other Kanto-related professors include Professor Cerise (studying world mysteries) and
        Professor Friede, though Friede leads the Rising Volt Tacklers and is connected to Kanto through his past and
        travels. In the Pokémon
        anime, the Kanto region is the setting for Ash Ketchum's original journey and several subsequent arcs. While it
        shares its basic layout with the video games, the anime version is significantly larger and includes numerous
        exclusive locations that are not present in the games. </p>
