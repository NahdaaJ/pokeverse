            'em
            all!

            city), and Lavender Town (known for its Pokémon Tower).

        <p>The Kanto region is the first region introduced in the
            Pokémon series.
            It
            is home to many iconic Pokémon
            and the
            original eight gyms.Kanto Pokémon are the original 151 creatures from the first generation of Pokémon games
            (Red,
            Blue, Yellow, FireRed, LeafGreen, Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee) set in the Kanto region, featuring iconic starters
            like
            Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and legendaries such as Mewtwo and the Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres trio,
            forming the
            foundational Pokédex that introduced trainers to the world of Pokémon battles and exploration.The main
            Pokémon
            Professor in the Kanto region is Professor Samuel Oak, based in Pallet Town, who studies human-Pokémon
            relationships, gives starter Pokémon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle) to new trainers, and tasks them with
            completing the Pokédex. Other Kanto-related professors include Professor Cerise (studying world mysteries)
            and
            Professor Friede, though Friede leads the Rising Volt Tacklers and is connected to Kanto through his past
            and
            travels. In the Pokémon
            anime, the Kanto region is the setting for Ash Ketchum's original journey and several subsequent arcs. While
            it
            shares its basic layout with the video games, the anime version is significantly larger and includes
            numerous
            exclusive locations that are not present in the games. </p>
